# AI Product Manager Portfolio — Sarita

Welcome to my AI Product Management portfolio. This repository showcases my work, thinking, and deliverables as an AI Product Manager—focusing on product strategy, AI use cases, data & metrics, experiments, and cross-functional execution.

## About

I am building an AI PM portfolio to demonstrate the end-to-end work I do: identifying opportunities, scoping AI solutions, defining metrics, collaborating with engineering and ML teams, running experiments, and driving product launches with a focus on responsible and practical AI.

## What's inside

- Case studies that describe the problem, approach, impact, and lessons learned ✅
- Product specs and PRDs for AI features 🔧
- Roadmaps and prioritization artifacts 🗺️
- Metrics, success criteria, and experiment summaries 📊
- Design mocks and data flow diagrams 🎨
- Notes on ethics, fairness, and governance of AI models ⚖️

## How to use this repo

- Browse the `projects/` folder for full case studies and artifacts.
- See `resume.pdf` (if added) for a snapshot of my experience and skills.
